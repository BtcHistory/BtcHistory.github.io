True, but the upside to using the BitCoin address is that two people can
communicate via a number of different channels to verify the address.
If my friend gets my address off my website, and thinks something fishy
is going on, he can call me, or IM me, or email me, etc. to verify the
address.  An attacker would then have to basically be replacing my
address with the malicious one in every possible communications channel,
including voice, which is a difficult feat.  MITMing the direct
communication via network addresses doesn't have that benefit because
the attacker is spoofing the address or intercepting.  My friend can
verify what my address is with me in the same ways, however verifying
the address doesn't actually improve the situation.

That is a good solution.  If you transact regularly you probably already
have the other person's BitCoin address in your address book.

One thing that came to mind on this topic is the potential for BitCoin
loss if you have a system failure.  The application doesn't seem to
store any data in the directory that it runs in, so I assume it's stored
in the registry and other places (haven't cracked out ProcessExplorer
yet to check myself), so it may be a good idea to have the application
be able to export everything that it needs for recovery to a file that
could be backed up off of the system.

You could always make that optional, such as a toggle that says
'Advertise my BitCoin address to the network' that the user could turn
on or off.  If you're not found on the network when searched for by
BitCoin address, the transaction is inserted into the block-chain as
normal.  If you are, the transaction meta-data could be communicated to
the network address.

One other thing I noticed today is that if you close the application it
doesn't appear to cleanly close it's network sockets (TCP RST's start
flying).  Probably an item for the low-priority todo list (:

Talk to you later,
