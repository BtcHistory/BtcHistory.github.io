I'm currently reading through your paper.  At the timestamp server
section you mention newspapers and usenet, so I thought you might be
interested in this if you have not seen it already:

http://www.publictimestamp.org/

By the way, I'm also currently running the alpha code on one of my
workstations.  So far it has two "Generated" messages, however the
"Credit" field for those is 0.00 and the balance hasn't changed.  Is
this due to the age/maturity requirement for a coin to be valid?

Thanks, I hadn't seen that yet.  It looks very well presented.
There was an older one that's been running for a long time that
publishes its hashes to Usenet.  I'm surprised this one isn't
using Usenet, although it is kind of difficult to get access to
post to Usenet in an automated way these days.  If they can get a
magazine or newspaper to publish their hashes, it would work a lot
easier in court for their purposes.  Bitcoin and all timestamp
servers share the basic functionality of periodically collecting
things into blocks and hashing them into a chain.

Right, the credit field stays 0.00 until it matures, then it'll be
50.00.  Do you think it would be clearer if I left the credit
field blank until it matures?  I should put some text in the
transaction details (when you double click on it) explaining how
it works.  (was it obvious you can doubleclick on a line for
details?)

Be sure to upgrade to v0.1.3 if you haven't already.  This version
has really stabilized things.

It actually posts the hash blocks to a Google Group called
'proof-hashes', so similar result as if it were posting to Usenet.

http://groups.google.com/group/proof-hashes

Since I run that group, and it's sole purpose is to archive
proof-of-work hashes, feel free to join an account to have your system
post there as well if you like.

No, I think having $0.00 there is more appropriate than being blank.
The entries in my BitCoin software (4 of them now) all say 'unconfirmed'
however, so I'm not sure what that means, but I did grok that the coins
were generated and just not 'mature' yet, but I had also read your
whitepaper so I may have understood that concept from there.  When the
coins mature, will that generate a new 'credit' transaction, or will the
existing generation transaction line's credit field be updated?

No, I was unaware that you could double-click a transaction line for
further details...  I just did that and it currently just has the same
information there that is in the transaction line.  Putting more
information there would definitely be useful.

I was running 0.1.1... I will update now.  Perhaps a new version
notification or auto-update feature is in order? (:

Electronic currency and cryptography are two things that I am very
interested in so as you would assume I was drawn to this project
immediately when I saw it posted to the Cryptography email list.  Feel
free to ping me for feedback or to test out new features, I'll be happy
to help out.

Two issues with upgrading:

When closing my previous version (help said 0.1.1 but I think it was
really 0.1.0), the process did not exit.  The UI exited but the process
remained.  I had to manually kill the process before I was able to start
version 0.1.3.

Upon opening version 0.1.3, all four of my transaction entries still say
'unconfirmed', but now the Descriptions say 'Generated (not accepted)'.
Does this mean that some other node had extended the chain first and my
coins were generated in a dead branch?  If so, why did the previous
instance of the software not detect this immediately and begin
generating coins in the winning branch?  Bug in 0.1.0?

I'll watch this instance and see how it goes...

Thanks,

One other question I had... What prevents the single node with the most
CPU power from generating and retaining the majority of the BitCoins?
If every node is working independently of all others, if one is
significantly more powerful than the others, isn't it probable that this
node will reach the proper conclusion before other nodes?  An
underpowered node may get lucky once in a while, but if they are at a
significant horsepower advantage I would expect the majority of BitCoins
to be generated by the most powerful node.

Sweet, I was looking for a group like that on Usenet at one point to see
what I would use if I needed, and nothing really fit.  I'm sure Google
groups is a lot easier to post to.

There are some scenarios where a Usenet or Google group could be used as
a supplemental defence.  Bitcoin is at its most vulnerable in the
beginning when the total network CPU power is small.  That's offset by
the fact that the incentive to attack it is also low when it's small.
Hopefully the easy solution of just growing up and getting past that
stage will work.  If not, there are ways a Google group could help, if
it really came to that.

We definitely have similar interests!

You know, I think there were a lot more people interested in the 90's,
but after more than a decade of failed Trusted Third Party based systems
(Digicash, etc), they see it as a lost cause.  I hope they can make the
distinction, that this is the first time I know of that we're trying a
non-trust based system.

The existing transaction line will change.

You're right, sorry about that.  It's the bug that was fixed in 0.1.3.
The communications thread would get blocked, so you would make
connections, but they would go silent after a while.  When you found a
block, you couldn't broadcast it to the network, so it didn't get into
the chain.  You weren't receiving anything either to know that the
network had gone on without you, until you restarted it.

The bug is also what caused bitcoin.exe to fail to exit.  The
communications thread was blocked and failed to exit.  Bitcoin does a
careful shutdown in case it might be in the middle of an important
transaction, but actually it's completely safe to kill it.

This is all fixed in 0.1.3.  If you give me your IP, I'll send you some
coins.

It's not like a race where if one car is twice as fast, it'll always
win.  It's an SHA-256 that takes less than a microsecond, and each guess
has an independent chance of success.  Each computer's chance of finding
a hash collision is linearly proportional to it's CPU power.  A computer
that's half as fast would get half as many coins.


> I'll watch this instance and see how it goes...

Let me know how it goes.  If you have any trouble with it, send me your
debug.log file.  I can often figure out what went wrong just from that.

Yea, that particular group is completely open, you don't have to join to
post (in fact I think I made it difficult for people to actually join),
you just email proof-hashes@googlegroups.com and the content of the
email gets posted to the group.

Yea, I was thinking you could have a client post the current block chain
every 10k blocks or something, just to occasionally document the current
winning proof-of-work chain.

Indeed.

Yea, that was the primary feature that caught my eye.  The real trick
will be to get people to actually value the BitCoins so that they become
currency.  Currently, they're just collections of bits...

I'm currently at 24.28.79.95, but that's dynamic so it may change.  I've
had that address for a while though so hopefully my dhcp client is being
successful at renewing and not losing my address.  It does change from
time to time, but that address should be good for a while.

Ahh I see... So each guess is like the spin of a roulette wheel,
completely independent from all other guesses and the extra CPU power
just translates to more successful guesses than anyone else.
Unfortunately my ability to understand complex mathematics is conversely
proportional to how interested I am in cryptography (:

I'm glad to see you considered the possibility of a BitCoin client
making a payment to itself and have an appropriate description in the
transaction log (:

I did this primarily so that I could get a packet capture of the network
traffic during a transaction to analyze.  Without knowing your packet
structure, I only see a bit of cleartext information in the packets,
mostly just what is shown in the transaction detail such as name and
comments.  There are a couple of other strings that show upon the wire
such as 'version' and 'reply', but the rest is pretty cryptic.

While pondering transactions, I realized that there is no identifiable
information involved other than an IP address or a BitCoin address.  In
the case of the IP transaction, the BitCoin client seems to trust that
the IP that it has connected to really is the intended recipient of the
transaction.  It is fairly trivial to launch a man-in-the-middle attack
and steal incoming transactions.  Consider the scenario where a
co-worker and myself have our workstations on the same LAN.  Being
nefarious, I could be ARP poisoning the local broadcast domain and
routing all traffic destined for his workstation through my workstation
as an intermediary.  Both of us, not being good employees, play the
MMORPG-du-jour and like to buy and sell game items using BitCoins.  I
could easily watch for incoming connections on TCP port 8333 and
terminate them at my workstation rather than passing those particular
connections on to his workstation.  A bit convoluted, yes, but it
illustrates the point.  This type of attack could be performed at any
hop along the route between the two transacting parties.  If I were an
evil admin at Big ISP USA, well, you get the idea.

I would recommend not allowing the use of network addresses as the
address of an intended recipient.  I would think it would be a bit more
secure to always require a BitCoin address and do transactions that way.
If I understand how that is done correctly, you just compute the
transaction into the block chain and let the intended recipient
'discover' it, correct?  An alternative could be to allow the network
nodes to provide a resolution service, where they ask around for the
network address of a BitCoin address, and if that node is online, once a
consensus is agreed upon by the network for that address the sending
BitCoin application connects directly there.  Because the BitCoin
addresses are tied to the keys of the node, I would think that some
method could be devised to prove ownership of that BitCoin address by
the sending node and not to proceed with the transaction if so.  At the
very least I would recommend, if you intend to retain the recipient
addressing by IP method is to allow for matching a hash of a shared
secret between the parties or something that an intermediary would not
know, but since you have the crypto in place, keys generated, etc.
anyhow, using that would be a much stronger solution.

Or am I over-thinking this and the network connection is just to send
immediate notification of the transaction and context information such
as the comment?  The BitCoin application mentioned getting the
recipient's public key and a few other things, and there seems to be a
lot more going on in the network traffic than what would be required for
a simple notification.

There's at least one node who's inbound IP keeps changing all the
time within the same class B.  Maybe every time the program is
run.  I wasn't expecting that.

Hal sort of alluded to the possibility that it could be seen as a
long-odds investment.  I would be surprised if 10 years from now
we're not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know
a way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the TTP
gets cold feet.

Even if it doesn't take off straight away, it's now available for
use by the next guy who comes up with a plan that needs some kind
of token or electronic currency.  It could get started in a closed
system or narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens,
currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites.  Once it
gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could
effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping
coins in a vending machine. 

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  "Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."

Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.

I group attacks into two classes:
1) Attacks that can only be done by someone actually in the chain
    of communication
2) Attacks that can be done by anyone on the Internet from anywhere

Type 1 exposes you to people in your house or company on your
local LAN, admins at ISPs in between, and the LAN on the
recipient's side.  Type 2 exposes you to a billion people who can
self-select to be attackers and get economy of scale when they
develop one technique to attack multiple victims.

Sending by IP requests a new public key, so yes, it's vulnerable
to type 1 man-in-the-middle.  If that's a concern, sending to a
Bitcoin address doesn't have that vulnerability, although there's
a small privacy tradeoff.  I have a feeling most of the time
people will get Bitcoin addresses off of non-SSL websites and
unsigned cleartext e-mail, which is already vulnerable to type 1
and type 2 through DNS poisoning.

One solution would be to use both the IP and Bitcoin addresses
when sending (maybe 1.2.3.4-1Kn8iojk...), where the recipient uses
the public key of the Bitcoin address to sign the new public key
to prove that you're sending to who you think you are.  If the
system starts to be used for real business purposes, I will
certainly implement that.  Another solution is to use SSL.

For now, it's pretty obvious that if you send to an IP, you didn't
give any other identifying information about the recipient, so
you're blindly sending to whoever answers that IP.

Another feature for later is an option to encrypt your wallet.

It would be nice to only need the Bitcoin address and have the IP
worked out behind the scenes.  Might have privacy or denial of
service issues.  Certainly before another sending method is
implemented, there's plenty of time now to fully think through the
design and make sure it's the best way.

True, but the upside to using the BitCoin address is that two people can
communicate via a number of different channels to verify the address.
If my friend gets my address off my website, and thinks something fishy
is going on, he can call me, or IM me, or email me, etc. to verify the
address.  An attacker would then have to basically be replacing my
address with the malicious one in every possible communications channel,
including voice, which is a difficult feat.  MITMing the direct
communication via network addresses doesn't have that benefit because
the attacker is spoofing the address or intercepting.  My friend can
verify what my address is with me in the same ways, however verifying
the address doesn't actually improve the situation.

That is a good solution.  If you transact regularly you probably already
have the other person's BitCoin address in your address book.

> Another feature for later is an option to encrypt your wallet.

One thing that came to mind on this topic is the potential for BitCoin
loss if you have a system failure.  The application doesn't seem to
store any data in the directory that it runs in, so I assume it's stored
in the registry and other places (haven't cracked out ProcessExplorer
yet to check myself), so it may be a good idea to have the application
be able to export everything that it needs for recovery to a file that
could be backed up off of the system.

You could always make that optional, such as a toggle that says
'Advertise my BitCoin address to the network' that the user could turn
on or off.  If you're not found on the network when searched for by
BitCoin address, the transaction is inserted into the block-chain as
normal.  If you are, the transaction meta-data could be communicated to
the network address.

One other thing I noticed today is that if you close the application it
doesn't appear to cleanly close it's network sockets (TCP RST's start
flying).  Probably an item for the low-priority todo list (:

Pretty sure that's not me.  My BitCoin application at work should be
coming from our static NAT address and my connection at home has had the
IP that I gave you for at least 3 days now (that I've been transferring
coins between them for test purposes).

Yes, I saw that message and was one of the other reasons I started up a
node so quickly.  My systems aren't doing much of anything else while
idle, so why not create BitCoins?  And if they're worth something
someday...? Bonus!

I can see how various types of sites that have a need for micropayments
could use them, however I also see an impedement to adoption if they
want to use an existing BitCoin peer group rather than a closed system
since they would first have to generate enough coins to support what
they intend to do (or buy them from someone else).  A closed system
obviously doesn't have that problem.

I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
gets cold feet.

It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
sites.  Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
for services that could almost be free but not quite.

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  "Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."

Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.

It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.  If
enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy.  Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

The files are in "%appdata%\Bitcoin", that's the directory to
backup.  The data is stored in a transactional database DBM, so
it should be safe from loss if there's a crash or power failure.

%appdata% is per-user access privilege.  Most new programs like
Firefox store their settings files there, despite the headwind of
Microsoft changing the directory name with every Windows release
and being full of spaces and so long it runs off the screen.

I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
gets cold feet.

It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
sites.  Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
for services that could almost be free but not quite.

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  "Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."

Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.

It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.  If
enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy.  Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

Hey Satoshi,

After that first transfer of 25.00, you didn't send me another 100.00
did you?  I sent myself 100.00 from my BitCoin application at work to my
one at home using the BitCoin address rather than by IP.  My application
at home has a 100.00 transfer received, however it's transaction details
say "Received with: Satoshi 12higDjoCCNXSA95xZMWUdPvXNmkAduhWv".  That
is not my BitCoin address from work, so I assume this means that I
received the payment encoded with a block that was computed by your
client?  If so, how did it know your name in addition to the BitCoin
address that generated it?  I don't recall there being a place in my
application to even put my name.

It should be your Bitcoin address at home that you received it
with.  There's no way for it to know who it's from, so the best
it can do is tell which of your addresses it was received on.
You can create multiple addresses and give a different address
to each person and label them to help figure out who's sending
to you.

It doesn't know any names other than what you tell it.  The name
printed there is what's associated in your address book for that
address, either under the Address Book button or the "Change..."
button to the right of your Bitcoin address.

Ah!  I didn't even notice it was my address at home, you're right (:  I
do have multiple addresses created at home so I didn't make the
connection.

Ahh you're right, 'Satoshi' is associated with the address that received
the payment under the Change button's addresses.  I don't recall setting
that value though, is that the default or something? (this is the first,
default, address that the application generated itself when I first ran
it)

The first default one is labelled "Your Address" when it's created.

All the places where address book labels are set are where the user manually sets it.  The only time it automatically adds a label is a blank one when you send to a new address.  I guess you could have entered the label on an address you thought was mine but the software was confusing and you put it in the wrong place.

Address book labels for receiving addresses is confusing but I'm not sure what else to do.  Anyone using it for more than just simple purposes would need to create different receiving addresses for each payer so they could tell who's paying them.  That concept doesn't have much analogy in the real world.

That would make sense, I bet that's what happened.

I think had it said "Received with address: X" rather than just
"Received with: X" I think I would have understood, although I'm sure
that address being mislabeled 'Satoshi' was the primary reason for my
initial confusion.  You're right though, there's really nothing
comparable in the current financial system that people are used to other
than maybe being able to use multiple recipient email addresses for
PayPal.  Perhaps it could say "Received payment to: X"?

Another factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
spam.  They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the
message.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
too high for spam to be cost effective. 

The process has the potential to establish the POW token's value
in the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could
buy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would
temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the
self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the
spammers.

Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of
spam called "dusting".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust
in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.
 If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're
willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a
message with it, users could set how much they're willing to get
paid to receive spam.
