Pretty sure that's not me.  My BitCoin application at work should be
coming from our static NAT address and my connection at home has had the
IP that I gave you for at least 3 days now (that I've been transferring
coins between them for test purposes).

Sure, no problem.

I'll join right now, thanks (:

Yes, I saw that message and was one of the other reasons I started up a
node so quickly.  My systems aren't doing much of anything else while
idle, so why not create BitCoins?  And if they're worth something
someday...? Bonus!

I can see how various types of sites that have a need for micropayments
could use them, however I also see an impedement to adoption if they
want to use an existing BitCoin peer group rather than a closed system
since they would first have to generate enough coins to support what
they intend to do (or buy them from someone else).  A closed system
obviously doesn't have that problem.

Interesting application (:

Another good idea.
