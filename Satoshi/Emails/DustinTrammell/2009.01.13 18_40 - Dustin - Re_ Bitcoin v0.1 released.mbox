Yea, that particular group is completely open, you don't have to join to
post (in fact I think I made it difficult for people to actually join),
you just email proof-hashes@googlegroups.com and the content of the
email gets posted to the group.

Yea, I was thinking you could have a client post the current block chain
every 10k blocks or something, just to occasionally document the current
winning proof-of-work chain.

Indeed.

Yea, that was the primary feature that caught my eye.  The real trick
will be to get people to actually value the BitCoins so that they become
currency.  Currently, they're just collections of bits...

I'm currently at 24.28.79.95, but that's dynamic so it may change.  I've
had that address for a while though so hopefully my dhcp client is being
successful at renewing and not losing my address.  It does change from
time to time, but that address should be good for a while.

Ahh I see... So each guess is like the spin of a roulette wheel,
completely independent from all other guesses and the extra CPU power
just translates to more successful guesses than anyone else.
Unfortunately my ability to understand complex mathematics is conversely
proportional to how interested I am in cryptography (:

Will do...
