I'm currently reading through your paper.  At the timestamp server
section you mention newspapers and usenet, so I thought you might be
interested in this if you have not seen it already:

http://www.publictimestamp.org/

By the way, I'm also currently running the alpha code on one of my
workstations.  So far it has two "Generated" messages, however the
"Credit" field for those is 0.00 and the balance hasn't changed.  Is
this due to the age/maturity requirement for a coin to be valid?

Cheers,
