It actually posts the hash blocks to a Google Group called
'proof-hashes', so similar result as if it were posting to Usenet.

http://groups.google.com/group/proof-hashes

Since I run that group, and it's sole purpose is to archive
proof-of-work hashes, feel free to join an account to have your system
post there as well if you like.

No, I think having $0.00 there is more appropriate than being blank.
The entries in my BitCoin software (4 of them now) all say 'unconfirmed'
however, so I'm not sure what that means, but I did grok that the coins
were generated and just not 'mature' yet, but I had also read your
whitepaper so I may have understood that concept from there.  When the
coins mature, will that generate a new 'credit' transaction, or will the
existing generation transaction line's credit field be updated?

No, I was unaware that you could double-click a transaction line for
further details...  I just did that and it currently just has the same
information there that is in the transaction line.  Putting more
information there would definitely be useful.

I was running 0.1.1... I will update now.  Perhaps a new version
notification or auto-update feature is in order? (:

Electronic currency and cryptography are two things that I am very
interested in so as you would assume I was drawn to this project
immediately when I saw it posted to the Cryptography email list.  Feel
free to ping me for feedback or to test out new features, I'll be happy
to help out.
