That would make sense, I bet that's what happened.

I think had it said "Received with address: X" rather than just
"Received with: X" I think I would have understood, although I'm sure
that address being mislabeled 'Satoshi' was the primary reason for my
initial confusion.  You're right though, there's really nothing
comparable in the current financial system that people are used to other
than maybe being able to use multiple recipient email addresses for
PayPal.  Perhaps it could say "Received payment to: X"?
